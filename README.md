# data-viz
The first repository ever. Created for some projects in data analysis and data visualization using Python instrumentation and methods.

1. The first step here is a test project regarding data analysis and visualisation of a streaming platform;
2. This platform is virtual - only random generated data is used for this mini-project;
3. The foundtion of this project is a workshop lead by Mathshub;
4. I'll comment each step and make resume regarding collected data and graphs showed.
